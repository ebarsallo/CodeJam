# 11.1  You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at
#       the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

# 11.2  Write a method to sort an array of string so that all the anagrams are next to
#       each other.

# 11.3  Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of
#       times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array
#       was originally sorted in incresing order.
#       EXAMPLE
#       Input: find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}
#       Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)

# 11.5  Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a
#       method to find the location of a given string.
#
#       EXAMPLE:
#       Input: find "ball" in {"at", "", "", "", "ball", "", "", "car",
#                              "", "", "dad", "", ""}
